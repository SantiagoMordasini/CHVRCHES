              <h3>Early life and education</h3>
      
              <p>Lauren Mayberry was born in 1987 in Thornhill, Stirling. She has played the piano since she was a child and drums since she was a teenager.
      
                  </p>
              <p>Lauren Mayberry attended Beaconhurst School, an independent school in Bridge of Allan. She also lived in Gladstone, Illinois as a foreign-exchange student. After completing a four-year undergraduate law degree at the University of Strathclyde, she earned a master's degree in journalism in 2010. This led her into a career in freelance journalism and production running. From 2009 to 2010 she was a contributor to the UK music website The Line of Best Fit.</p>
                  
              <hr>

              <h3>Musical career</h3>
      
              <p>From age 15 until 22, she played drums in various bands. Prior to Chvrches, Lauren Mayberry was involved in two local bands, Boyfriend/Girlfriend and Blue Sky Archives. In Blue Sky Archives, she was a vocalist and played the drums and keyboards. As a member of Blue Sky Archives, Mayberry also covered the Rage Against the Machine song "Killing in the Name" which was released as a single.</p>
      
              <p>In September 2011, Iain Cook of Aereogramme and The Unwinding Hours produced Blue Sky Archives' Triple A-Side EP. Cook started a new project with his friend Martin Doherty and asked Mayberry to sing on a couple of demos. They wrote together for seven or eight months in a basement studio in Glasgow. Cook, Mayberry and Doherty decided to form a new band after the sessions proved to be successful. The band chose the name Chvrches, using a Roman "v" to distinguish themselves from actual churches on internet searches.</p>
      
              <p>In 2013, the band signed to Glassnote Records after releasing the tracks, "Lies" and "The Mother We Share" in 2012. Their debut EP, Recover, was released in 2013. The band released their debut album, The Bones of What You Believe, on 20 September 2013.</p>
      
              <p>Lauren Mayberry has collaborated with artists such as Marshmello, Death Cab For Cutie, Bleachers, The National, the lead singer of Paramore, Hayley Williams, and The Cure's frontman, Robert Smith.</p>

              <h3>Activism and philanthropy</h3>
      
              <h4>Feminism and women's rights</h4>
      
              <p>Lauren Mayberry is a vocal feminist and is the founder of TYCI, a feminist collective in Glasgow.[27] Her ongoing work with the organisation includes written contributions to the online magazine and blog, and she can be heard regularly on TYCI podcasts. The group also holds live events, raising money for charities like Glasgow Women's Aid. <br>
      
                  In September 2013, Mayberry wrote an article for The Guardian in response to misogynist messages she received online. She wrote:
                  
                  What I do not accept ... is that it is all right for people to make comments ranging from 'a bit sexist but generally harmless' to openly sexually aggressive. That it is something that 'just happens'. Is the casual sexual objectification of women so commonplace that we should all just suck it up, roll over and accept defeat? I hope not. Objectification, whatever its form, is not something anyone should have to 'just deal with'. <br>
                  
                  She discussed the issue again in a Talks at Google session in 2014 and on Channel 4 News, following aggressive responses to the band's video for "Leave a Trace". <br>
                  
                  Lauren Mayberry is a patron of Rape Crisis Glasgow and has been involved with other organisations such as Water Aid, The Yellow Bird Project, Wild Aid and Plus 1, donating a portion of Chvrches' ticket sales to Amnesty International. She has also been involved with Glasgow's Rock School For Girls and Amy Poehler's Smart Girls. <br>
                  
                  In 2015, Mayberry wrote about an abusive personal relationship for Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham's Lenny Letter. In December 2016, Mayberry took part in a fundraiser show with Carly Rae Jepsen, Lorde and Charli XCX for the Ally Coalition, an organisation started by Jack Antonoff to raise money for homeless LGBT youth</p>
      
              <h4>United States politics</h4>
      
              <p>Lauren Mayberry has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration and has attributed his presidency with the rise of global activism for social issues, calling him "an unpunished sexual predator in office." Referring to the mixed reaction by the crowd to a Trump joke she told at a concert, Mayberry said "you can't say you don't think he's a racist. You can't say you don't think he's a sexist. You can't say you don't think he's transphobic and homophobic, 'cause he has shown us who he is."</p>
      
              <p>Lauren Mayberry is a staunch advocate for gun control in the United States. Following the Sutherland Springs church shooting, Mayberry released a video on her Twitter account criticising President Trump's response, arguing that "itâ€™s somewhere on the scale from ironic to disgustingly hypocritical that Donald Trump is talking about mental health with regards to this attack when his administration has done nothing but try to restrict access to help get care for people who need it the most". She further recounted her memory of the Dunblane massacre in which 16 children and one teacher were murdered with handguns, resulting in sweeping gun control legislation in the UK. Mayberry credits these efforts with substantially decreasing the number of mass shootings in the UK.</p>

              <h3>Personal life</h3>
              <p>Lauren Mayberry currently lives in Los Angeles. <br>
      
                  Lauren Mayberry and actor Justin Long have engaged in multiple philanthropic activities together, including hosting a holiday variety show charity fundraiser at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles and travelling together to Nicaragua to visit a women's shelter. In May 2018, The Guardian identified Justin Long as Mayberry's boyfriend. Lauren Mayberry has since suggested that these claims are false.
                  
                  In September 2018, People reported that "Justin Long has split from Chvrches frontwoman Lauren Mayberry, whom he began dating in 2016."During an interview with Rolling Stone in October 2018, Mayberry indicated that she is single.</p>
      
                  <p>In 2019-2020 she started to date with Samuel Stewart, guitarist of "Lo Moon" band
